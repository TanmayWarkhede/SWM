Smart Waste Management System
🌍 Overview
The Smart Waste Management System is an AI-powered solution designed to revolutionize urban waste sorting. Leveraging real-time machine learning and computer vision, the system automatically classifies waste into categories such as plastic, textile, and wood with high accuracy. It addresses the core challenges of current waste management practices including contamination, inefficiencies, and high operational costs.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 Real-Time Waste Detection
Uses cameras and AI to identify waste types instantly at the source.

🧠 Machine Learning Integration
Trained on diverse datasets to ensure high classification accuracy across various waste categories.

🏙️ Urban-Ready and Scalable
Designed for smart city integration with minimal human intervention.

♻️ Enhanced Recycling Efficiency
Improves recycling rates by minimizing contamination during segregation.

💰 Cost-Effective Operations
Reduces labor, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions through optimized waste handling.
